        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The reason for people to come my site is to gain a firsthand experience of the wonderful world of poetry. 
        There they will be able to read some different examples of poetry and learn of different poets. 
        This will be an area where people can come to be creative and find their passion in writing poetry.
        The website will be designed so the first page introduces the audience to the website and gives a layout
         of what the people can find and expect from the website itself. It will have links to the other pages.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Poems and Poets</h3>
      <p>
        The second page will introduce the audience to different examples of poems and poets. Here is where they will get 
        familiar with forms and styles of poetry that has been written over the years. Different poets and their stories such
        as Ralph Waldo Emmerson or Edgar Allen Poe. This part of the website will be changing over a period. 
        To allow different Poets and poems to circulate.

      <h3>Creations</h3>
      <p>
        The third page will be focused on providing a space where the people will have a chance to write their own poetry. 
        I am thinking of having a way for the people to be able to log into an account for a way to be able to save poems written.
